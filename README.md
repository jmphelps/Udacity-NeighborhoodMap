##Neighborhood Map Project

For this project we will be using the Knockoutjs framework and Googlemaps API to create a single page
application of some local distilleries across North Carolina. When a user clicks on a distillery the corresponding
marker will bounce and an asyncronous call to the weatherunderground API runs and returns the current temperature
to the user in the infoWindow. List items and markers will also be filtered if users perform a search with the search
box.

###Technology Used
-Bootstrap 3
-Jquery
-Knockoutjs
-[Weather Underground API] (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs)
